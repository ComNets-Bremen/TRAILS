# SFO Taxi Cab Traces

The original San Fransisco taxi cab traces (available at CRAWDAD) are required to create the TRAILS traces used by the scripts in the folder `Scripts/SFO-Taxi-Cabs`. These traces have to be downloaded from `https://crawdad.org/epfl/mobility/20090224/`. The download should contain the tar file `cabspottingdata.tar.gz` which, when expanded, will create the folder `cabspottingdata`.
